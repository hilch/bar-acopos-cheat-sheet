# B&amp;R ACOPOS Cheat Sheet

## Mission
Sometimes it might be easier to use just one sheet of paper for diagnosis on a B&amp;R ACOPOS servo drive.
And this is where this complete "cheat sheet" comes into play.
Feel free to print this sheet on DIN A3. DIN A4 might also work if you've got good eyes. :smiley:

## Development
I used Open Source Tool ['Inkscape'](https://inkscape.org/en/) to draw.
